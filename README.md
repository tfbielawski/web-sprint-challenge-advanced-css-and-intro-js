# Sprint Challenge: Advanced CSS and Intro to JavaScript - Influential Artists

**Read these instructions carefully. Understand exactly what is expected _before_ starting this Sprint Challenge.**

This challenge allows you to practice the concepts and techniques learned over the past week and apply them in a concrete project. This Sprint explored advanced CSS and introductory JavaScript concepts. During this Sprint, you studied responsive web design, variable declaration, conditionals, loops, functions, arrays, and objects. In your challenge this week, you will demonstrate proficiency by creating a website of influential artists with data from an object.

This is an individual assessment. All work must be your own. Your challenge score is a measure of your ability to work independently using the material covered through this sprint. You need to demonstrate proficiency in the concepts and objectives introduced and practiced in preceding days.

You are not allowed to collaborate during the Sprint Challenge. Your work reflects your proficiency in Responsive Design, and JavaScript Basics.


## Introduction

In this challenge, you will use a data set of artists to build an "influential artists" webpage. This data comes from a set of "50 influential artists" on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/ikarus777/best-artworks-of-all-time). We have reduced the data to just 20 artists to make it slightly easier to work with. You are free to work with the full data set as a stretch goal.

### Commits

Commit your code regularly and meaningfully. 

## Interview Questions
### (please edit this file and write your answer below each question. In addition, you may also review these questions with your mentor)

Please answer the following questions below, you may edit the readme file to include your answers below the question.

1. How would you describe accessibility on the web to someone new to programming?
Accessibility refers to design that accounts for people with impairments who may be using certain technologies to assist them with viewing web pages. 

Accessibility has become a design philosophy accepted throughout the industry, and most organizations strive to comply with accessibility standards.

2. Talk about 3 different things you can do to ensure your website is accessible. 
Developers can do many things to ensure websites are accessible. Among them are: ensuring you use semantic tags (like header, footer, article, main, etc), which impart specific meaning to accessibility viewing/reading devices; be mindful when using non-semantic tags (like div and span) because they do not convey any meaning; use alt tags where possible to provide better descriptions; be mindful when using tables as they are difficult for accessibility technologies to follow.

3. How would you explain the concept of a variable to someone new to programming?
A variable is an empty container, which has no value until you give it a value.

We have to tell the computer that we want to use a variable, and tell it what we we want to call it. This is called declaring a variable. Assigning a variable its value is called initinitialization. For example: let x = 45, means we want the computer to let us use x as a variable, and we want to initialize it (add value to it) with the number 45.

X, however, tells us nothing about what that number 45 actually means.

Variables should have descriptive names that are useful in imparting their meaning when read by others, and their names should be relevant to the project and code. 

If your program calculates a dinner bill, use variables that represent the factors in that calculation. For example: totalBill should represent the total of the bill before addingg tax and tp; salesTax should represent the percent sales tax to be calculated; subtotalBeforeTip should represent the total amount before tip is added; tipAmount should represent percent tip to be calculated; finalBill should represent the final amount with all calculations added.


4. What is the purpose of using functions in code?
Functions are blocks of code that allow developers to do certain tasks. Functions help us write less code, because well-written functions can be used over and over in a program. Code reusability helps developers write more efficient, more streamlined code. 

Wordy code makes it more difficult to debug when problems arise.

Often, with slight modification, functions from one program can also be used in other programs.

You are expected to be able to answer questions in these areas. Your responses contribute to your Sprint Challenge grade. 

## Instructions

### Task 1: Project Set-Up

Follow these steps to set up your project:

1. Fork the repo
2. Clone your forked version of the repo
3. cd into your repo and create a branch with your first and last name
NOTE: Tests will run for the JavaScript portion of this challenge only
4. open the terminal in your vs code and type `npm install`
5. next type `npm run test:watch` in your terminal
6. Complete your work making regular commits, once you have all your tests passing and you are ready to submit your work please see canvas for instructions on how to submit

### Task 2a:  Minimum Viable Product - Responsive Design

*Before you jump in, take 10 minutes to review the code that has already been provided for you. Take time to see how the home page was built. During this time, [Review the provided design files](design/). You have been provided all content necessary in the [index.html file](index.html) and basic styling in the [index.css file](css/index.css).*

* [x] Add a viewport meta tag to the head of your index.html page.
* [x] Add responsive breakpoints to your code for 500px such that your styles match the [mobile design file](design/Mobile.png).

### Task 2b: Minimum Viable Product - JavaScript

Navigate to `index.js` and complete the MVP challenges. Note that you need to scroll past data (or collapse data in VScode) to find the challenges below.

### Task 3: Stretch Problems

After finishing your required elements, you can push your work further. These goals may or may not be things you have learned in this module but they build on the material you just studied. Time allowing, stretch your limits and see if you can deliver on the following optional goals:

* [ ] Website is responsive at multiple breakpoints and looks good in-between breakpoints because student is using responsive units of measurement where appropriate. Student is using most semantic HTML for each element on page and has included ARIA roles where applicable (More research may be required to implement ARIA roles)  

* [ ] Student demonstrates and can explain a deep understanding of basic programming concepts when walking Team Lead through the explanation of their code.
* [ ] Use advanced array methods (.map, .reduce, .filer) to refactor your MVP code (create an array of all artists born in the 1900s with .filter, for example) - do this seperate from your MVP tasks
